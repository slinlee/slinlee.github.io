[Fifty Fares, by Ronan Takagi](https://smile.amazon.com/Fifty-Fares-Ronan-Takagi/dp/1521989958/)

üëçüèΩ

A guy in his mid-thirties feels stuck in a rut so he decides to drive for Uber.

The stories of the fifty fares he drives are vignettes of LA life and 
personalities. His commentary and reflections are insightful, often self 
deprecating, and always hilarious. If this sounds interesting at all, check it 
out. It's a quick fun read. 

I'd been reading this book outloud to my baby to get in the habit of reading to 
her. We were part way through the book when we made our road trip to LA so it 
was on my mind we were driving around. His stories added life to neighborhoods I
didn't know before, and I imagined being an Uber driver stuck in 
all that traffic. I don't think I could cut it driving that much-- four days was
already a lot.

I'd recommend the book even if I hadn't known the author back in college. 
After he graduated, we didn't stay in touch so I didn't know he had started writing.
 Very sadly, I found out from a [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/kent-morizawa-fight-against-lymphoma) 
 page set up because he had terminal cancer.

RIP Kento.
