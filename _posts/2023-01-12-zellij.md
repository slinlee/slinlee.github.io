The trends in the software-that-has-caught-my-attention the last few years:

- 'batteries-included' - Managing and hacking together huge config files for things like vim isn't that fun for me. I like sane defaults. One of the arguments for learning and using vim is that it's on every system... but if I'm using a heavily customized vim, then it's not the same on every system.
- terminal based - very responsive interfaces, even on the 'underpowered' computers I use, like Chromebooks, Raspberry Pi.
- vim style keybindings. But also key-bindings that are chained and make sense semantically. Helix and zellij even show hints and menus for commands to make it easier to learn.
  - Example: In Helix, to search text across a project, it's `<space>, /` (spacebar, then `/`) rather than combining many modifiers like `cmd-shift-f`. Also, to do things related to tabs in zellij, it's `ctrl-t, n` (to create a [n]ew tab), a pane would be `ctrl-p, n`
- Written in Rust. This just seems common on projects started within the last few years?
- Positive and active communities
- Open source

## Some projects I've liked

- [helix](https://helix-editor.com) - replaces vim
- [zellij](https://zellij.dev) - replaces tmux
- [fish shell](https://fishshell.com)

## Some things I'd be interested in finding

- todo list - should somehow sync with a phone too
- email - neomutt is okay but feels messy
