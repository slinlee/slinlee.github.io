The best bike bell is one like the [Crane Bring Bring Bell](https://www.rivbike.com/products/crane-riten-rotary-bell).

It's ring is loud and friendly. Other brass bells might be easy to hear, but they're so insistent sounding they startle people walking. "What are you doing in my way? On your left!"

The sound of a rotary bell makes our toddlers giggle. "Hi! I'm having a great time, I hope you are too!"

It's the auditory equivalent of seeing an upright riding position.
