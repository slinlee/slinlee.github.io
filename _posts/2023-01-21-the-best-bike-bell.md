The best bike bells are ones like the [Crane Bring Bring Bell](https://www.rivbike.com/products/crane-riten-rotary-bell).

The ring is loud and friendly, like a toddler's laughter. "Hi! I'm having a great time, I hope you are too!"

Other brass bells might be easy to hear, but they're so insistent sounding they startle people walking. "What are you doing in my way? On your left!"
