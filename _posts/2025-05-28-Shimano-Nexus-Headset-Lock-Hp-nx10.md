Here's some info about the Shimano headset lock. It toggles on and off to keep the bars from flopping around while parked. I wanted it especially because I carry loads in a front basket and the bars are always turning while I'm loading and unloading my kids from the rear seat. I've gotten pretty good at holding the bike up clenched between my thighs, but it'd be nicer if I didn't have to.

I picked up a headset lock last year but still haven't gotten around to installing in on my Clem.

The model name is the Nexus Headset Lock HP-NX10

There aren't many instructions but here's what I've found :
