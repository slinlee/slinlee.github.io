Dear In-N-Out,

Today driving down to LA we made the traditional stop for In-N-Out at Kettleman City. George[^1] was very kind and hooked us up with the “Free-hot-cocoa-for-kids-on-rainy-days” even though our 'kid' is only six months old. My wife enjoyed the cocoa.

By the way, thanks for putting a baby-changing table in the women's restroom. It came in handy today. It would also be handy if there was a changing table in the men’s restroom so Dads could change babies too. Even better would be a family-friendly baby room so that we could go in together to take care of the baby.

Thanks!

S
