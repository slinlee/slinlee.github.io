## Adventure time!
While traveling together in Iceland in 2015, we both fell in love with the country so much that we wanted our closest family and friends to see it too.  

The official wedding events are happening from **July 2 - 5** in Iceland. **To best experience Iceland, we recommend staying *at least *one week.**

Can't make it to Iceland? We're also planning a reception in the San Francisco Bay Area in August 2017. We'll update you with more details as planning continues.

## Guest Travel Plans
We’re working with wedding planners Pink Iceland for our upcoming wedding in Iceland. We’d like to ask you to direct your questions directly to them regarding any details you may need for your upcoming trip.

If you plan on extending your stay in Iceland please get in touch with Pink Iceland about all your travel and accommodation needs. They have a dedicated team of people organizing self-drives and advising on and booking tours, activities and accommodation.

Their service is free and you will not pay more than if you book directly. They make their money from commissions, but you can trust them give good, honest advice.
