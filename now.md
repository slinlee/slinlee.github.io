# What I'm doing now

## Being a dad and husband
It's the best. The three of us plus our dog hang out together in our studio and listen to Whitney Houston. 

## Winter guide
It's the season for ETC's Winter Program so I'll be heading up to the Sierras to bring people with disabilities outdoors to cross country ski and check out the sequoia trees.
That reminds me, it's time to renew my CPR and First Aid certifications.

## Photography
I just finished a short class in darkroom photography printing, so I've been spending time printing my snapshots.
It's so much fun seeing my photos as tangible things that I can give people as gifts.
